# Homework 6 - Weather Dashboard

The aim of this assignment was to create a weather dashboard, using APIs and AJAX calls,that will output current weather, as well as a 5 day forecast when a city is searched. It should also list recent searches on a sidebar, with the option to click and re-run those searches.

## Composition of Website and Code

Whenever I could, I used jQuery to code the javascript. I created some basic HTML framework, a CSS file, and javascript file. I used a combination of some built in HTML and dynamically generated HTML.

## Process

I first tackled the API calls, making sure I could produce current weather, forecasted weather, and UV conditions with 3 different API URLS, with a default (Evanston) location. Then I researched how to add icons denoting the weather conditions. stackoverflow was helpful for this as I learned that the icon information was included in the response object output, and were hosted URL images.

I did some pseudo coding to break down the steps for creating the calls and outputing the data, and for the onclick events.


During and after completing the assignment, I commented out each step of my javascript code, so that when I come back to it, I could understand exactly what I did and why. 

## Deployment

Aftering completing requirements for the assignment, I did a final update of the files in Github and deployed the website for review.

## Acceptance Criteria

The weather dashboard is an attempt at minimum specs of the assignment, which produces current and forecasted weather conditions upon search. Feedback on best practices, and improvements I could make would be helpful.
